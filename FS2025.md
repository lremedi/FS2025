# Inspired by: [Code Search with Vector Embeddings and Qdrant](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/cookbook/blob/main/notebooks/en/code_search.ipynb)

- Parse Codebase using an [LSP - Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) tool (for real not like the example above) to generate LSIF file
- Process LSIF file to grab code snippets and it's references (file name, start, end)
- AI to read snippets and generate descriptions
- Tokenize code and descriptions
- Semantic search code API
- Maybe making it part of CI
- Enhance content generation (description, tasks) from AI tool by referencing code snippets. (tools)
